Changelog
=========

Version 0.3.0-beta
==================

- In Jupyter notebooks, VariableViewer now has a column for input/output type.
- Changed base OAD process so that propulsion model can now be directly called
  by the performance module instead of being a separate OpenMDAO component (which
  is still possible, though). It prepares the import of FAST legacy
  mission-based performance model.

Version 0.2.2-beta
==================

- Changed dependency requirement to have OpenMDAO version at most 3.1.0
  (FAST-OAD is not yet compatible with 3.1.1)

==================

- Fixed compatibility with wop 1.9 for XDSM generation


Version 0.2.0b
==============

- First beta release


Version 0.1.0a
==============
